## Original project requirements and further info

Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.

For detailed instructions on how to get started, check out this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub?embedded=true).

## Sources
Most of the engine, the images, and resources.js came from the repo that this one was forked from.  Basic code for the modal came from w3schools.  See code comment for more specific details.

### No contributions accepted.

Project is still in active development.  In this stage, it is simply the bare minimum requirement for the project.  Once active development has ended, contributions will be reconsidered.  Feel free to fork and use this code as you wish in the meantime.
